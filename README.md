# Football-Match-Prediction-machine-learning-

This project builds a football match prediction model using machine learning. It analyzes past match data and creates rolling (last-3 matches) performance features like goals, shots, possession, and opponent strength. A Random Forest classifier is used to predict whether a team will win a match.

The notebook includes:

> Data cleaning & feature engineering

> Rolling form statistics

> Train-test split based on match dates

> Model training and evaluation using precision score

This is a baseline sports analytics model that can be improved with more features like team rankings, player stats, and advanced ML tuning.
